# Feature Specification: Palette Switcher

**Feature Branch**: `003-palette-switcher-i`
**Created**: 2025-10-07
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "palette-switcher. I want later user to switch in app between palletes defined in design system. So this is about update current design system to be able to do that"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: actors (user), actions (switch between palettes), data (design system palettes), constraints (palettes must be defined in design system)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How many palettes should be available? Just light/dark or multiple themes?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should palette preference persist across sessions?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Where in the UI should the palette switcher be accessible?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should the switch be instantaneous or animated?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow identified: User navigates to switcher ‚Üí selects palette ‚Üí palette applies immediately
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Marked ambiguous requirements with clarifications needed
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Palette, User Preference
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties - see clarification markers"
8. Commit spec to git:
   ‚Üí git checkout -b spec/003-palette-switcher-i (temporary branch for spec)
   ‚Üí git add .specify/specs/003-palette-switcher-i/spec.md
   ‚Üí git commit -m "docs: add specification for palette-switcher"
   ‚Üí git push origin spec/003-palette-switcher-i
9. Create GitHub issue for spec review:
   ‚Üí Title: "[Spec] Palette Switcher"
   ‚Üí Labels: "feature", "spec", priority label (P2)
   ‚Üí Assignee: Architecture Agent
   ‚Üí Body: Link to spec file in git + summary
   ‚Üí Add to project board column: "üìê Spec & Design"
10. ‚ö†Ô∏è STOP and WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL (MANDATORY)
   ‚Üí Display: "Spec created. GitHub issue #XXX created."
   ‚Üí Display: "Spec branch: spec/003-palette-switcher-i"
   ‚Üí Display: "Please review spec at .specify/specs/003-palette-switcher-i/spec.md"
   ‚Üí Display: "WAITING FOR APPROVAL to proceed to /plan"
   ‚Üí User must explicitly approve before /plan can run
11. After approval:
    ‚Üí Stay on spec branch (do NOT merge to main yet)
    ‚Üí Proceed to /plan command
12. Return: SUCCESS (spec approved, ready for /plan)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a user of the application, I want to switch between different visual color palettes so that I can customize the appearance of the interface to match my preferences or accessibility needs. The palettes are predefined in the design system and should apply consistently across the entire application.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the application is loaded with a default palette, **When** the user opens the palette switcher, **Then** all available palettes defined in the design system are displayed as options
2. **Given** the user is viewing the palette switcher, **When** the user selects a different palette, **Then** the application immediately applies the new palette to all UI elements
3. **Given** the user has selected a custom palette, **When** the user refreshes the page [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should preference persist?], **Then** the selected palette [may or may not] remain active
4. **Given** a palette is being switched, **When** the transition occurs, **Then** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should it be instant or smoothly animated?]
5. **Given** the user navigates between different sections of the app, **When** viewing content, **Then** the selected palette remains consistently applied

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a palette is invalid or missing design tokens?
- How does the system handle browser theme preferences (light/dark mode)?
- What is the fallback behavior if no palette is selected?
- Should the palette switcher be accessible to all users or require specific permissions?
- How does palette switching affect accessibility (contrast ratios, WCAG compliance)?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Design system MUST define multiple color palettes with complete token sets (colors, backgrounds, borders, shadows, etc.)
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a palette switcher UI component accessible to users
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to select from all available palettes defined in the design system
- **FR-004**: System MUST apply the selected palette immediately across all application UI elements
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure palette changes affect all components consistently (buttons, forms, cards, navigation, etc.)
- **FR-006**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: persist user palette preference? If yes, where - localStorage, server, cookies?]
- **FR-007**: Design system MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: how many palettes? Light/dark only, or multiple themes like blue, green, high-contrast?]
- **FR-008**: Palette switcher MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: where should it be located in the UI? Header, settings page, floating widget?]
- **FR-009**: Palette switching MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: include transition animations or apply instantly?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST ensure all palettes meet accessibility standards (WCAG contrast requirements)
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide a default palette when no preference is set or available

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Palette**: A complete set of design tokens defining colors, backgrounds, borders, and visual properties for the entire application. Each palette has a unique identifier and name.
- **User Preference**: The user's selected palette choice, which determines the active visual theme. Relationship: User (1) ‚Üí (0..1) Palette preference.

## GitHub Integration

**Spec Issue**: #[pending]
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è AWAITING USER APPROVAL

**MANDATORY**: User must review and approve this specification before proceeding.

**Review Checklist for User**:

- [ ] Requirements are clear and complete
- [ ] Scope is well-defined and bounded
- [ ] User scenarios make sense
- [ ] No major concerns or missing requirements

**Key Clarifications Needed**:

1. How many palettes should be available? (e.g., light/dark, or multiple themes)
2. Should palette preference persist across sessions?
3. Where should the switcher be accessible in the UI?
4. Should palette transitions be animated or instant?
5. Where should preferences be stored if persisted?
6. Should all users have access or is it permission-based?
