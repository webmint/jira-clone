# Feature Specification: Palette Switcher

**Feature Branch**: `003-palette-switcher-i`
**Created**: 2025-10-07
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "palette-switcher. I want later user to switch in app between palletes defined in design system. So this is about update current design system to be able to do that"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: actors (user), actions (switch between palettes), data (design system palettes), constraints (palettes must be defined in design system)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How many palettes should be available? Just light/dark or multiple themes?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should palette preference persist across sessions?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Where in the UI should the palette switcher be accessible?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should the switch be instantaneous or animated?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow identified: User navigates to switcher ‚Üí selects palette ‚Üí palette applies immediately
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Marked ambiguous requirements with clarifications needed
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Palette, User Preference
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties - see clarification markers"
8. Commit spec to git:
   ‚Üí git checkout -b spec/003-palette-switcher-i (temporary branch for spec)
   ‚Üí git add .specify/specs/003-palette-switcher-i/spec.md
   ‚Üí git commit -m "docs: add specification for palette-switcher"
   ‚Üí git push origin spec/003-palette-switcher-i
9. Create GitHub issue for spec review:
   ‚Üí Title: "[Spec] Palette Switcher"
   ‚Üí Labels: "feature", "spec", priority label (P2)
   ‚Üí Assignee: Architecture Agent
   ‚Üí Body: Link to spec file in git + summary
   ‚Üí Add to project board column: "üìê Spec & Design"
10. ‚ö†Ô∏è STOP and WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL (MANDATORY)
   ‚Üí Display: "Spec created. GitHub issue #XXX created."
   ‚Üí Display: "Spec branch: spec/003-palette-switcher-i"
   ‚Üí Display: "Please review spec at .specify/specs/003-palette-switcher-i/spec.md"
   ‚Üí Display: "WAITING FOR APPROVAL to proceed to /plan"
   ‚Üí User must explicitly approve before /plan can run
11. After approval:
    ‚Üí Stay on spec branch (do NOT merge to main yet)
    ‚Üí Proceed to /plan command
12. Return: SUCCESS (spec approved, ready for /plan)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a design system maintainer, I want to structure the design system to support multiple switchable color palettes so that applications using the design system can implement palette switching functionality. The design system should provide the infrastructure (tokens, CSS variables, palette definitions) that applications can leverage to switch themes dynamically.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the design system exists, **When** multiple palettes are defined, **Then** each palette contains a complete set of design tokens (colors, backgrounds, borders, shadows, etc.)
2. **Given** palettes are defined in the design system, **When** a developer inspects the structure, **Then** palettes are organized in a way that allows programmatic switching (e.g., via CSS variables, data attributes, or class names)
3. **Given** a component uses design tokens, **When** a different palette is activated, **Then** all token references automatically resolve to the new palette's values
4. **Given** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: how many palettes should be defined?], **When** reviewing the design system, **Then** each palette is fully documented with its purpose and token values
5. **Given** the design system is used in an application, **When** the application switches palettes, **Then** all components render correctly without requiring individual component changes

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a palette is missing some design tokens?
- Should there be a fallback/default palette defined?
- How should the design system handle custom or user-defined palettes?
- Should palette definitions support inheritance or composition?
- How does each palette ensure accessibility compliance (contrast ratios, WCAG compliance)?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Design system MUST define [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: how many palettes? Light/dark only, or multiple themes?] with complete token sets (colors, backgrounds, borders, shadows, text, etc.)
- **FR-002**: Design system MUST organize palette definitions in a structure that enables programmatic switching
- **FR-003**: Each palette MUST include all tokens required for complete UI rendering (no missing tokens)
- **FR-004**: Design system MUST provide a mechanism (e.g., CSS custom properties, data attributes) that allows applications to switch between palettes
- **FR-005**: Design system MUST document each palette's purpose, use cases, and token values
- **FR-006**: Design system MUST ensure all defined palettes meet WCAG accessibility standards (contrast requirements)
- **FR-007**: Design system MUST designate one palette as the default/fallback
- **FR-008**: Palette structure MUST allow Storybook to preview components in all available palettes
- **FR-009**: Design system MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should palettes support composition/inheritance, or be completely independent?]
- **FR-010**: Token naming convention MUST support palette switching without component code changes

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Palette**: A complete set of design tokens defining colors, backgrounds, borders, text, shadows, and other visual properties. Each palette has a unique identifier, name, and purpose documentation.
- **Design Token**: An atomic design value (color, spacing, typography, etc.) that belongs to one or more palettes. Tokens are the building blocks that palettes organize and define.

## GitHub Integration

**Spec Issue**: #88

## ‚ö†Ô∏è APPROVAL GATE

**MANDATORY**: User must review and approve this specification before proceeding.

**Review Checklist for User**:

- [ ] Requirements are clear and complete
- [ ] Scope is well-defined and bounded
- [ ] User scenarios make sense
- [ ] No major concerns or missing requirements

**Key Clarifications Needed**:

1. How many palettes should be defined in the design system? (e.g., light/dark only, or multiple themes)
2. Should palettes support composition/inheritance, or be completely independent?
3. What is the preferred mechanism for palette switching? (CSS custom properties, data attributes, CSS classes, etc.)
4. Should the design system include palette-specific component variants, or should all components work universally with any palette?

**After Review**:

- ‚úÖ **APPROVED**: Respond with "Approved, proceed with /plan"
- ‚ùå **CHANGES NEEDED**: Comment with required changes

**Next Step**: After user approval, run `/plan` command
