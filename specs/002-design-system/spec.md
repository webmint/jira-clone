   ‚Üí Add to project board column: "üìê Spec & Design"
10. ‚ö†Ô∏è STOP and WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL (MANDATORY)
   ‚Üí Display: "Spec created. GitHub issue #XXX created."
   ‚Üí Display: "Spec branch: spec/[###-name]"
   ‚Üí Display: "Please review spec at .specify/specs/[###-name]/spec.md"
   ‚Üí Display: "WAITING FOR APPROVAL to proceed to /plan"
   ‚Üí User must explicitly approve before /plan can run
11. After approval:
    ‚Üí Stay on spec branch (do NOT merge to main yet)
    ‚Üí Proceed to /plan command
12. Return: SUCCESS (spec approved, ready for /plan)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06

- Q: What theme support does the design system need? ‚Üí A: Light and dark mode support (two themes)
- Q: What color categories should the palette include? ‚Üí A: Primary, secondary, semantic (success/error/warning/info), and neutral grays
- Q: What spacing system should be used? ‚Üí A: Relative rem units (e.g., 0.25rem, 0.5rem, 1rem, 1.5rem, 2rem)
- Q: What accessibility standard must the color palette meet for contrast ratios? ‚Üí A: WCAG 2.1 Level AAA (minimum 7:1 for normal text, 4.5:1 for large text)
- Q: What additional style categories should the design system define? ‚Üí A: Border radius, shadows, transitions/animations, z-index scale, and opacity values
- Q: What is the color palette selection process? ‚Üí A: Provide 5 different professional color palette proposals during development for user selection. Palettes must be business-appropriate (professional appearance, balanced saturation - not too bright/shiny, not too dark/boring)

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a developer or designer working on the application, I need a consistent set of design tokens and style definitions so that the application maintains visual consistency across all screens and components. The design system should provide a single source of truth for typography, colors, spacing, and other foundational styles, with Roboto as the primary typeface.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a developer is building a new feature, **When** they need to apply text styles, **Then** they can reference standardized typography definitions using the Roboto font family
2. **Given** a designer is creating mockups, **When** they need to specify colors, **Then** they can use predefined color tokens that match the application's brand
3. **Given** a developer needs to apply spacing, **When** they implement layouts, **Then** they can use consistent spacing values from the design system
4. **Given** multiple developers working on different features, **When** they apply styles, **Then** all features maintain visual consistency through shared design tokens
5. **Given** the application needs to support light and dark mode, **When** styles are applied, **Then** the design system provides color tokens for both themes and allows switching between them
6. **Given** the design system is being developed, **When** color palettes are created, **Then** 5 different professional palette proposals are presented for selection, each with balanced saturation suitable for business applications

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the Roboto font fails to load or is unavailable?
- How should developers handle scenarios where design tokens don't cover a specific use case?
- What is the fallback behavior for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: responsive design - are there breakpoint-specific styles, mobile/desktop variations?]

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a complete typography scale using Roboto as the primary font family
- **FR-002**: System MUST define font weights, sizes, and line heights for different text hierarchies (headings, body text, captions, etc.)
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a comprehensive color palette with semantic naming
- **FR-004**: System MUST define color categories including primary, secondary, semantic (success, error, warning, info), and neutral grays for both light and dark themes
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide spacing scale for consistent margins, padding, and gaps
- **FR-006**: System MUST define spacing scale using relative rem units (e.g., 0.25rem, 0.5rem, 1rem, 1.5rem, 2rem)
- **FR-007**: System MUST include fallback fonts for Roboto to ensure text is readable if primary font fails
- **FR-008**: System MUST define additional style categories including border radius, shadows, transitions/animations, z-index scale, and opacity values
- **FR-009**: System MUST be accessible to developers and designers through [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: consumption method - CSS variables, design tokens file, style guide documentation?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST support light and dark mode theme switching
- **FR-011**: Typography scale MUST ensure readability at [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: target screen sizes and devices - mobile, tablet, desktop, or specific breakpoints?]
- **FR-012**: Color palette MUST meet WCAG 2.1 Level AAA standards for contrast ratios (minimum 7:1 for normal text, 4.5:1 for large text)
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide 5 different professional color palette proposals during development for user selection, each meeting business-appropriate aesthetic criteria (professional appearance, balanced saturation - avoiding overly bright/shiny or dark/boring extremes)

### Key Entities

- **Design Token**: A named value representing a design decision (e.g., color, spacing value, font size). Each token has a semantic name and a corresponding value.
- **Typography Definition**: Specification for text styles including font family (Roboto), font weight, font size, line height, and letter spacing for different text hierarchies.
- **Color Definition**: Named color values organized by category (primary, secondary, semantic, neutral) for both light and dark themes, meeting WCAG 2.1 AAA contrast standards.
- **Spacing Scale**: Set of predefined spacing values in relative rem units that create consistent rhythm and visual hierarchy in layouts.
- **Border Radius Scale**: Predefined corner radius values for consistent rounded edges across components.
- **Shadow Scale**: Layered shadow definitions for creating depth and elevation hierarchy.
- **Z-Index Scale**: Ordered stacking context values for managing overlay layers.
- **Transition Definitions**: Standard animation timing and easing functions for consistent motion.
- **Opacity Scale**: Predefined transparency levels for consistent visual hierarchy.
