# ADR 001: Adopt Storybook for Component Development

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Jira Clone project requires a component preview system that allows the design subagent to create and validate UI components in isolation before the frontend development subagent implements them in the main application. This enables an iterative design workflow and ensures visual consistency.

## Decision

We will adopt Storybook 8.x with Vue 3 + Vite integration for component development and preview.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Components can be developed and previewed in isolation
- Automatic accessibility testing (WCAG 2.1 AA) via addon-a11y
- Interactive documentation for all components
- Fast HMR with Vite builder
- Supports design-first workflow

### Negative

- Additional build tool to maintain
- Learning curve for story creation
- Increased dev dependencies

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Histoire.dev**: Newer Vue-focused tool, less mature ecosystem
2. **Manual component playground**: Time-consuming, no automated testing
3. **Component library without preview**: Missing visual validation step
