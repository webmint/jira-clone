## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input

2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Commit spec to git:
   ‚Üí git checkout -b spec/[###-feature-name] (temporary branch for spec)
   ‚Üí git add .specify/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md
   ‚Üí git commit -m "docs: add specification for [feature-name]"
   ‚Üí git push origin spec/[###-feature-name]
9. Create GitHub issue for spec review:
   ‚Üí Title: "[Spec] Feature Name"
   ‚Üí Labels: "feature", "spec", priority label (P1/P2/P3)
   ‚Üí Assignee: Architecture Agent
   ‚Üí Body: Link to spec file in git + summary
   ‚Üí Add to project board column: "üìê Spec & Design"
10. ‚ö†Ô∏è STOP and WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL (MANDATORY)
   ‚Üí Display: "Spec created. GitHub issue #XXX created."
   ‚Üí Display: "Spec branch: spec/[###-name]"
   ‚Üí Display: "Please review spec at .specify/specs/[###-name]/spec.md"
   ‚Üí Display: "WAITING FOR APPROVAL to proceed to /plan"
   ‚Üí User must explicitly approve before /plan can run
11. After approval:
    ‚Üí Stay on spec branch (do NOT merge to main yet)
    ‚Üí Proceed to /plan command
12. Return: SUCCESS (spec approved, ready for /plan)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a developer working with design and frontend development subagents, I need a visual component preview system that allows me to review and validate UI component designs in isolation before the frontend development subagent implements them in the main application. This enables an iterative design workflow where visual designs can be created, reviewed, and approved independently from application integration.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the development environment is set up, **When** a design subagent creates a new UI component design, **Then** the component should be viewable in an isolated preview environment without requiring integration into the main application

2. **Given** a component preview is available, **When** I view the component in the preview system, **Then** I should be able to see all visual states, variants, and interactive behaviors of the component

3. **Given** multiple components have been designed, **When** I access the preview system, **Then** I should see an organized catalog of all available component designs with navigation between them

4. **Given** a component design needs revision, **When** the design subagent updates the component, **Then** the preview should reflect the changes automatically without manual intervention

5. **Given** a component design is approved, **When** the frontend development subagent begins implementation, **Then** they should have access to the approved component design as a reference

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a component has dependencies on other components that don't exist yet?
- How does the system handle components with external data requirements or API calls?
- What happens when a component design includes assets (images, icons, fonts) that aren't available?
- How are responsive design variations previewed across different viewport sizes?
- What happens when a component requires application-level context (routing, state management, authentication)?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide an isolated environment for previewing UI components independently from the main application

- **FR-002**: System MUST allow design subagents to create component previews that include multiple visual states (default, hover, active, disabled, error, loading, etc.)

- **FR-003**: System MUST automatically detect and display new or updated component designs without requiring manual catalog updates

- **FR-004**: System MUST provide navigation capabilities to browse through all available component designs

- **FR-005**: System MUST support viewing components across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewport sizes following a mobile-first approach to validate responsive design

- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve the visual fidelity of components, including styling, spacing, typography, and colors as designed

- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to interact with components in the preview environment to validate interactive behaviors (clicks, hovers, focus states, etc.)

- **FR-008**: System MUST provide detailed documentation for each component including its purpose, available properties, prop types, usage examples, and design guidelines

- **FR-009**: System MUST integrate with the design-to-development workflow where the design subagent creates component previews with Tailwind specifications, and the frontend development subagent references these previews during implementation

- **FR-010**: System MUST support viewing component variations (different sizes, themes, configurations) side by side for comparison

- **FR-011**: System MUST handle component isolation, allowing components to be viewed as pure visual mockups without requiring external dependencies like routing, global state, or authentication

- **FR-012**: System MUST provide accessibility testing capabilities to validate components meet standard accessibility requirements including color contrast, keyboard navigation, and ARIA attributes

### Key Entities

- **Component Preview**: A visual representation of a UI component in isolation, including all its possible states and variations, used for design validation before implementation

- **Component Variant**: Different configurations or states of a component (e.g., primary button, secondary button, disabled button) that represent the full range of the component's visual and behavioral possibilities

- **Component Documentation**: Descriptive information about a component including its purpose, available properties, usage examples, and design guidelines

- **Preview Catalog**: An organized collection of all component previews with navigation and search capabilities for browsing available designs
