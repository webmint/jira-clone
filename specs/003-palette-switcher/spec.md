# Feature Specification: Palette Switcher

**Feature Branch**: `003-palette-switcher`
**Created**: 2025-10-07
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "palette-switcher. I want later user to switch in app between palletes defined in design system. So this is about update current design system to be able to do that"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: actors (user), actions (switch between palettes), data (design system palettes), constraints (palettes must be defined in design system)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ CLARIFIED: Use existing light and dark palettes already defined in tokens.css
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ CLARIFIED: Keep independent palette structure (no composition/inheritance)
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ CLARIFIED: Use CSS class switching mechanism (.light and .dark classes)
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ CLARIFIED: Components should be universal, using semantic tokens that work with all palettes
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow identified: User navigates to switcher ‚Üí selects palette ‚Üí palette applies immediately
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Marked ambiguous requirements with clarifications needed
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Palette, User Preference
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ All clarifications resolved, spec complete
8. Commit spec to git:
   ‚Üí git checkout -b spec/003-palette-switcher (temporary branch for spec)
   ‚Üí git add .specify/specs/003-palette-switcher/spec.md
   ‚Üí git commit -m "docs: add specification for palette-switcher"
   ‚Üí git push origin spec/003-palette-switcher
9. Create GitHub issue for spec review:
   ‚Üí Title: "[Spec] Palette Switcher"
   ‚Üí Labels: "feature", "spec", priority label (P2)
   ‚Üí Assignee: Architecture Agent
   ‚Üí Body: Link to spec file in git + summary
   ‚Üí Add to project board column: "üìê Spec & Design"
10. ‚ö†Ô∏è STOP and WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL (MANDATORY)
   ‚Üí Display: "Spec created. GitHub issue #XXX created."
   ‚Üí Display: "Spec branch: spec/003-palette-switcher"
   ‚Üí Display: "Please review spec at .specify/specs/003-palette-switcher/spec.md"
   ‚Üí Display: "WAITING FOR APPROVAL to proceed to /plan"
   ‚Üí User must explicitly approve before /plan can run
11. After approval:
    ‚Üí Stay on spec branch (do NOT merge to main yet)
    ‚Üí Proceed to /plan command
12. Return: SUCCESS (spec approved, ready for /plan)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a design system maintainer, I want to structure the design system to support multiple switchable color palettes so that applications using the design system can implement palette switching functionality. The design system should provide the infrastructure (tokens, CSS variables, palette definitions) that applications can leverage to switch themes dynamically.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the design system exists with light and dark palettes, **When** multiple palettes are defined, **Then** each palette contains a complete set of design tokens (colors, backgrounds, borders, shadows, etc.)
2. **Given** palettes are defined using CSS classes (.light and .dark), **When** a developer inspects the structure, **Then** palettes are organized to allow programmatic switching via class name changes on the root element
3. **Given** a component uses semantic design tokens, **When** a different palette is activated by changing the root class, **Then** all token references automatically resolve to the new palette's values
4. **Given** light and dark palettes are defined, **When** reviewing the design system, **Then** each palette is fully documented with its purpose, token values, and usage guidelines
5. **Given** the design system is used in an application, **When** the application switches palettes via class toggle, **Then** all components render correctly without requiring individual component code changes
6. **Given** components in Storybook, **When** previewing a component, **Then** Storybook provides controls to view the component in both light and dark palettes

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a palette is missing some design tokens? (Both palettes must have complete token coverage)
- How does the system fallback if no palette class is applied? (Light palette is the default via :root selector)
- Should the design system support custom palettes beyond light/dark in the future? (Out of scope for this feature, but structure should be extensible)
- How are accessibility violations detected and reported for each palette? (Need validation tooling/tests)
- What happens if a component uses a token that doesn't exist in a palette? (Should fail validation during build/test)

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Design system MUST maintain light and dark palettes (existing in tokens.css) with complete token sets (colors, backgrounds, borders, shadows, text, semantic states)
- **FR-002**: Design system MUST organize palette definitions using CSS classes (.light and .dark) that enable programmatic switching
- **FR-003**: Each palette (light and dark) MUST include all tokens required for complete UI rendering (no missing tokens between palettes)
- **FR-004**: Design system MUST use CSS class-based switching mechanism where applications toggle .light/.dark classes on the root element
- **FR-005**: Design system MUST document each palette's purpose, use cases, token values, and switching mechanism
- **FR-006**: Design system MUST ensure both light and dark palettes meet WCAG AA accessibility standards (minimum 4.5:1 contrast for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- **FR-007**: Design system MUST designate light palette as the default/fallback theme
- **FR-008**: Palette structure MUST allow Storybook to preview components in both light and dark palettes via theme switcher controls
- **FR-009**: Palettes MUST be independent (each defines complete token set) without composition or inheritance between them
- **FR-010**: Components MUST use semantic tokens (e.g., --color-text-primary, --color-background-default) that automatically resolve to palette-specific values
- **FR-011**: Design system MUST provide examples and guidelines for creating components that work universally with both palettes

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Palette**: A complete set of design tokens defining colors, backgrounds, borders, text, shadows, and other visual properties. Each palette has a unique identifier, name, and purpose documentation.
- **Design Token**: An atomic design value (color, spacing, typography, etc.) that belongs to one or more palettes. Tokens are the building blocks that palettes organize and define.
