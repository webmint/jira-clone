**Feature Branch**: `004-uibutton-component-you`
**Created**: 2025-10-08
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "uiButton-component you should create uibutton component according to design standarts. It should be simple button for now. So i need 3 types - filled, outline and text buttons. Also this buttons must be ready for pallete switcher. Also requirement to have possiblity to cheange button sizes and text sizes"

   ‚Üí git checkout -b spec/[###-feature-name] (temporary branch for spec)
   ‚Üí git add .specify/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md
   ‚Üí git commit -m "docs: add specification for [feature-name]"
   ‚Üí git push origin spec/[###-feature-name]
9. Create GitHub issue for spec review:
   ‚Üí Title: "[Spec] Feature Name"
   ‚Üí Labels: "feature", "spec", priority label (P1/P2/P3)
   ‚Üí Assignee: Architecture Agent
   ‚Üí Body: Link to spec file in git + summary
   ‚Üí Add to project board column: "üìê Spec & Design"
10. ‚ö†Ô∏è STOP and WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL (MANDATORY)
   ‚Üí Display: "Spec created. GitHub issue #XXX created."
   ‚Üí Display: "Spec branch: spec/[###-name]"
   ‚Üí Display: "Please review spec at .specify/specs/[###-name]/spec.md"
   ‚Üí Display: "WAITING FOR APPROVAL to proceed to /plan"
   ‚Üí User must explicitly approve before /plan can run
11. After approval:
    ‚Üí Stay on spec branch (do NOT merge to main yet)
    ‚Üí Proceed to /plan command
12. Return: SUCCESS (spec approved, ready for /plan)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a developer building UI components in the application, I need a standardized button component that adheres to the design system. The button must support different visual styles (filled, outline, text) to convey different levels of importance and hierarchy. The button must integrate with the existing palette switcher feature to ensure consistent theming across the application. The component must allow developers to configure button and text sizes to accommodate different use cases and screen densities.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the button component is available, **When** a developer uses it with the filled variant, **Then** the button displays with a solid background color from the active palette
2. **Given** the button component is available, **When** a developer uses it with the outline variant, **Then** the button displays with a transparent background and colored border from the active palette
3. **Given** the button component is available, **When** a developer uses it with the text variant, **Then** the button displays with no background or border, only colored text from the active palette
4. **Given** a button is rendered, **When** the user switches the application palette using the palette switcher, **Then** the button automatically updates its colors to match the new palette
5. **Given** the button component is available, **When** a developer configures a specific size, **Then** the button renders with the appropriate dimensions and padding
6. **Given** the button component is available, **When** a developer configures a text size, **Then** the button text renders at the specified size
7. **Given** a button is rendered, **When** a user hovers over it, **Then** the button displays an appropriate hover state using palette colors
8. **Given** a button is rendered, **When** a user clicks it, **Then** the button displays an appropriate active/pressed state using palette colors
9. **Given** a button is disabled, **When** it is rendered, **Then** the button displays at 50% opacity to indicate its disabled state
10. **Given** the button component is implemented, **When** a developer or designer opens Storybook, **Then** they can view and interact with all button variants, sizes, and states for documentation and design review purposes

### Edge Cases

- What happens when an invalid button variant is specified? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should system throw an error, default to a specific variant, or show a warning?]
- What happens when a size other than xs, small, medium, large, or xl is specified? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should system throw an error, default to a specific size, or show a warning?]
- What happens when a palette color is missing or undefined? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should system fall back to default colors, throw an error, or use a neutral color?]
- When button contains long text, the button expands its width to fit the content without truncating or wrapping
- What happens when the button is used in a disabled state but still receives click events? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should clicks be prevented at the component level or is that the parent's responsibility?]

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

- **FR-006**: Button MUST support five configurable sizes: xs, small, medium, large, and xl
- **FR-007**: Button MUST support configurable text sizes [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What are the specific text size options? Should they correspond to design system typography scales?]

- **FR-012**: Button MUST support flexible content combinations including text only, icons only, or both text and icons together
- **FR-013**: Button MUST expand its width to accommodate long text content without truncating or wrapping
- **FR-014**: Button colors MUST be sourced from the design system tokens to ensure consistency
- **FR-015**: Button MUST maintain consistent spacing and proportions according to design standards [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What are the specific spacing rules? e.g., padding ratios, min-width requirements?]
- **FR-016**: Button component MUST be documented and viewable in Storybook with all variants, sizes, and states visible for design review and development reference

### Key Entities

- **Button Component**: A reusable UI element that users can interact with to trigger actions, supporting three visual variants (filled, outline, text), multiple sizes, and integration with the palette system
- **Button Variant**: The visual style of the button (filled, outline, or text) that determines its appearance and visual hierarchy
- **Size Configuration**: Settings that control the physical dimensions and padding of the button
- **Text Size Configuration**: Settings that control the font size of the button label
- **Palette Integration**: Connection to the active design palette that provides color values for all button states
