# ADR 001: Adopt Storybook for Component Development and Design Preview

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2025-10-05
**Decision Makers**: Architecture Agent, Design Agent, Frontend Agent
**Tags**: `frontend`, `tooling`, `design-system`, `developer-experience`

## Context

The Jira Clone project requires a systematic approach to UI component development that supports:

1. **Design-First Workflow**: Design agents need to create and preview component designs in isolation before frontend agents implement them in the application
2. **Component Documentation**: Developers need clear examples of all component variants, states, and usage patterns
3. **Accessibility Testing**: All components must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards, requiring automated accessibility checks during development
4. **Responsive Design**: Components must be tested across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports (mobile-first approach)
5. **Interactive Testing**: User interactions (clicks, keyboard navigation, form inputs) need to be tested in isolation
6. **Development Velocity**: Fast feedback loops with hot module replacement (HMR) for rapid iteration

### Current State

- Vue 3.5 + Vite 7.x + Tailwind CSS 4.0 stack
- No component preview or documentation system
- Manual testing of component states and variants
- No automated accessibility checks
- No standardized way to demonstrate component usage

### Problem Statement

Without a component development environment:

- Designers cannot preview components in isolation
- Developers lack clear documentation of component APIs
- Accessibility issues are discovered late in the development cycle
- Responsive behavior is hard to test without full application context
- Component variants and states are undocumented
- No single source of truth for design system components

## Decision

We will adopt **Storybook 8.x** as the official component development and documentation tool for the Jira Clone frontend.

### Configuration

- **Framework**: `@storybook/vue3-vite` for Vue 3 + Vite integration
- **Story Format**: Component Story Format 3 (CSF3) with TypeScript
- **Addons**:
  - `@storybook/addon-essentials` - Controls, docs, actions, viewport, backgrounds
  - `@storybook/addon-a11y` - Automated accessibility testing (WCAG 2.1 AA)
  - `@storybook/addon-interactions` - Interactive behavior testing
  - `@storybook/addon-themes` - Theme switching support
  - `@storybook/test-runner` - CI/CD integration for story tests

### Story Organization

Stories will be co-located with components following atomic design hierarchy:

```
src/components/
├── atoms/Button/
│   ├── Button.vue
│   ├── Button.stories.ts
│   └── Button.spec.ts
├── molecules/FormField/
│   ├── FormField.vue
│   ├── FormField.stories.ts
│   └── FormField.spec.ts
└── organisms/IssueCard/
    ├── IssueCard.vue
    ├── IssueCard.stories.ts
    └── IssueCard.spec.ts
```

### Viewport Configuration

Mobile-first viewport presets:

- **Mobile**: 375px × 667px (default)
- **Tablet**: 768px × 1024px
- **Desktop**: 1440px × 900px

### Integration with Existing Stack

- Tailwind CSS imported in `.storybook/preview.ts`
- Vite's PostCSS processing used for Tailwind compilation
- TypeScript strict mode enforced in stories
- ESLint + Prettier applied to story files

## Rationale

### Why Storybook?

1. **Industry Standard**: Most widely adopted component development tool with mature ecosystem
2. **Vue 3 Support**: Official `@storybook/vue3-vite` integration with excellent TypeScript support
3. **Vite Integration**: Native Vite builder provides fast HMR (<100ms) matching our existing build tool
4. **Accessibility Built-in**: `addon-a11y` integrates axe-core for automated WCAG testing
5. **Interactive Testing**: `@storybook/test` enables testing user interactions within stories
6. **Auto-Documentation**: CSF3 stories automatically generate component documentation
7. **CI/CD Ready**: Test runner allows running stories as tests in continuous integration

### Why CSF3 Format?

- More concise than CSF2 (less boilerplate)
- Better TypeScript inference and autocomplete
- Recommended format for Storybook 7+ and 8+
- Type-safe with `satisfies Meta<typeof Component>`

### Why Co-located Stories?

- Keeps component, story, and tests together (single source of truth)
- Easier to find and maintain related files
- Clear ownership and responsibility
- Scales better than separate `/stories` directory

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Histoire.dev

**Pros**:

- Newer, Vite-first design tool
- Faster startup than Storybook
- Simpler configuration

**Cons**:

- Less mature ecosystem (fewer addons)
- Smaller community and less documentation
- No interaction testing addon
- Limited accessibility testing support

**Decision**: Rejected due to immature ecosystem and lack of critical addons (a11y, interactions)

### 2. Ladle

**Pros**:

- Extremely fast (Vite-native)
- Minimal configuration
- Small bundle size

**Cons**:

- Very limited addon ecosystem
- No accessibility testing
- No interaction testing
- Basic documentation features only

**Decision**: Rejected due to insufficient tooling for accessibility and testing requirements

### 3. No Tool (Manual Component Testing)

**Pros**:

- No additional dependencies
- Full control over testing approach

**Cons**:

- Manual work to preview component states
- No documentation generation
- No automated accessibility checks
- Slower development velocity
- Hard to share designs with stakeholders

**Decision**: Rejected as it doesn't support design-first workflow or accessibility requirements

### 4. Chromatic (Visual Regression Testing)

**Note**: Not mutually exclusive with Storybook (Chromatic extends Storybook)

**Pros**:

- Automated visual regression testing
- Cloud-based story hosting
- Design review workflows

**Cons**:

- Additional cost (SaaS product)
- Overkill for current project phase
- Requires Storybook anyway

**Decision**: Deferred to future consideration. Storybook provides sufficient value without Chromatic for now.

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Design-First Workflow Enabled**: Design agents can create component previews before implementation
2. **Automated Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance checked automatically for every story
3. **Faster Development**: HMR provides <100ms feedback loops for component changes
4. **Living Documentation**: Stories serve as executable documentation for component APIs
5. **Improved Quality**: Interaction tests catch regressions before they reach main application
6. **Responsive Testing**: Easy viewport switching enables testing mobile-first designs
7. **Stakeholder Communication**: Deployed Storybook provides shareable component library for design reviews
8. **CI/CD Integration**: Test runner allows automated testing of stories in continuous integration

### Negative

1. **Additional Dependencies**: Adds ~10 Storybook-related packages to `devDependencies`
2. **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn CSF3 format and Storybook addons
3. **Maintenance Overhead**: Stories must be kept in sync with component changes
4. **Build Time**: Adds Storybook build step to development workflow (~2s initial build)
5. **Storage Cost**: Deployed Storybook adds ~3-5MB to hosting requirements (if deployed)

### Mitigation Strategies

- **Learning Curve**: Provide comprehensive usage guide (`front/README.md`) and example components
- **Maintenance**: Make story creation part of Definition of Done for component development
- **Build Time**: Vite builder keeps build time acceptable (<2s is within tolerance)
- **Storage**: Only deploy Storybook to staging/review environments, not production

### Risks

| Risk                                      | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Stories become outdated                   | Medium     | Medium | Require story updates in component PR checklist                                 |
| Storybook version conflicts               | Low        | High   | Pin Storybook versions in package.json, test upgrades in separate branches      |
| Performance degradation with 200+ stories | Low        | Medium | Use Storybook lazy loading, monitor build times                                 |
| Team doesn't adopt tool                   | Medium     | High   | Provide training, enforce in code review, lead by example with Button component |

## Implementation Plan

See `tasks.md` for detailed implementation tasks. High-level phases:

1. **Phase 1**: Install Storybook and configure for Vue 3 + Vite + Tailwind
2. **Phase 2**: Create example Button component with comprehensive stories
3. **Phase 3**: Document story creation conventions and best practices
4. **Phase 4**: Integrate test runner into CI/CD pipeline
5. **Phase 5**: Validate with quickstart scenarios

## Success Metrics

After implementation, we will measure:

1. **Development Velocity**: Time to create and preview component reduced by >50%
2. **Accessibility Compliance**: 100% of components pass axe-core checks
3. **Documentation Coverage**: 100% of design system components have stories
4. **Story Health**: Stories stay in sync with components (measured by manual audit)
5. **Adoption**: 100% of new components include stories (enforced in PR reviews)
