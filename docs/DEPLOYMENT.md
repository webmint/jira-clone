# Deployment Guide

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-11
**Status**: Draft - To be completed when deployment infrastructure is configured

## Overview

This document describes the deployment process for the Jira Clone application.

> **Note**: This is a placeholder document. Complete this when deployment infrastructure is set up.

## Deployment Environments

### Development
- **Frontend**: Local Vite dev server (`http://localhost:5173`)
- **Backend**: Local NestJS server (`http://localhost:3000`)
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore (development project)

### Staging
> To be configured

### Production
> To be configured

## Prerequisites

### Required Accounts & Services
- [ ] Firebase project (for Auth + Firestore)
- [ ] Hosting service account (TBD - Vercel/Netlify/AWS/etc.)
- [ ] CI/CD platform configured (GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Domain name (if applicable)

### Environment Variables

#### Frontend Production Variables

```env
VITE_API_URL=https://api.your-domain.com
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=prod-api-key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-prod-project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-prod-project-id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-prod-project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=sender-id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=app-id
```

#### Backend Production Variables

```env
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-prod-project-id
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your-service-account@project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"

PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=production

# Security
CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-domain.com
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-random-secret
```

## Build Process

### Frontend Build

```bash
cd front
npm run build
```

**Output**: `front/dist/` - Static files ready for hosting

### Backend Build

```bash
cd back
npm run build
```

**Output**: `back/dist/` - Compiled JavaScript ready for Node.js runtime

## Deployment Steps

> To be documented when deployment platform is chosen

### Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] All tests pass in CI
- [ ] Code review approved
- [ ] No known security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Performance benchmarks pass
- [ ] Database migrations tested on staging
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Changelog updated
- [ ] Version bumped (semantic versioning)

### Deployment Workflow

```
main branch merge
    ↓
CI/CD Pipeline triggered
    ↓
Run tests (unit, integration, E2E)
    ↓
Build frontend & backend
    ↓
Deploy to staging
    ↓
Automated smoke tests
    ↓
Manual approval (for production)
    ↓
Deploy to production
    ↓
Post-deployment health checks
    ↓
Monitor for issues
```

## Firebase Configuration

### Firestore Security Rules

Production security rules must be reviewed and approved before deployment.

Example rules (to be customized):

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Authenticated users only
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }

    // More specific rules to be added
  }
}
```

### Firebase Auth Configuration

- Enable required sign-in methods
- Configure authorized domains
- Set up email templates
- Configure password requirements

## Monitoring & Observability

> To be configured

### Health Checks

- [ ] Frontend health endpoint
- [ ] Backend health endpoint
- [ ] Database connectivity check
- [ ] Firebase Auth status

### Logging

- [ ] Error logging configured
- [ ] Performance metrics collected
- [ ] User analytics (privacy-compliant)

### Alerting

- [ ] Error rate thresholds
- [ ] Performance degradation alerts
- [ ] Downtime notifications
- [ ] Security incident alerts

## Rollback Procedures

### Rollback Frontend

> To be documented

### Rollback Backend

> To be documented

### Database Rollback

> To be documented - Firestore doesn't support traditional migrations

## Scaling Considerations

### Frontend Scaling

- Static asset hosting scales automatically (CDN)
- No server-side rendering, so no scaling concerns

### Backend Scaling

- Consider containerization (Docker)
- Horizontal scaling for API servers
- Firebase Firestore scales automatically

## Security Considerations

### Production Security Checklist

- [ ] HTTPS enforced everywhere
- [ ] CORS properly configured (whitelist origins)
- [ ] Rate limiting configured
- [ ] Security headers set (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] Firebase security rules reviewed
- [ ] Secrets stored securely (not in code)
- [ ] Regular dependency audits (`npm audit`)

## Cost Optimization

### Firebase Costs

- Monitor Firestore reads/writes
- Optimize queries to reduce costs
- Use Firebase Blaze plan for production

### Hosting Costs

> To be documented based on chosen platform

## Troubleshooting

### Common Deployment Issues

> To be documented as issues arise

**Next Steps**:
1. Choose deployment platform (Vercel, Netlify, AWS, Railway, etc.)
2. Set up CI/CD pipeline in GitHub Actions
3. Configure staging environment
4. Document complete deployment process
5. Perform test deployments
6. Update this guide with actual procedures
